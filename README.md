# mg/dL

This experience, made almost entirely through p5Play, is meant to embody what it feels like to grow up with Type 1 Diabetes: almost no explaination on how to do things and having to fight for your life.

Yes, there is a small amount of absurdism when it comes to how fast the days go by, but that's what its like when your managing insulin all day.

I hope you enjoy! See how long you can last.
